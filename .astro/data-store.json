As winter's grip loosens, parks come alive with blooming wildflowers, gushing waterfalls, and active wildlife. Here are our top recommendations for spring visits.\r\n\r\n## 1. Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee/North Carolina\r\n\r\nThe Smokies are world-famous for their spring wildflower display, often called the \"Spring Spectacular.\" With over 1,500 flowering plant species, it's one of the most biodiverse temperate regions in the world.\r\n\r\n**Best time to visit:** Mid-April to early May for peak wildflower blooms.\r\n\r\n## 2. Yosemite National Park, California\r\n\r\nSpring snowmelt transforms Yosemite's waterfalls into thundering displays of natural power. Yosemite Falls, Bridalveil Fall, and others reach their peak flow, creating an unforgettable experience.\r\n\r\n**Best time to visit:** Late April to early June for maximum waterfall volume.\r\n\r\n## 3. Shenandoah National Park, Virginia\r\n\r\nThe Blue Ridge Mountains burst with color as redbuds, dogwoods, and countless wildflowers bloom along Skyline Drive and the park's many trails.\r\n\r\n**Best time to visit:** April through May.\r\n\r\n## 4. Joshua Tree National Park, California\r\n\r\nBefore summer's intense heat arrives, Joshua Tree offers pleasant temperatures and the possibility of desert wildflower blooms if winter rains have been sufficient.\r\n\r\n**Best time to visit:** March to early May.\r\n\r\n## 5. Zion National Park, Utah\r\n\r\nModerate temperatures make spring ideal for hiking Zion's famous trails like Angels Landing and The Narrows, while the Virgin River runs high from snowmelt.\r\n\r\n**Best time to visit:** April to May.\r\n\r\n## 6. Big Bend National Park, Texas\r\n\r\nThis remote desert park experiences brief but spectacular wildflower displays in early spring, with comfortable hiking temperatures before summer heat arrives.\r\n\r\n**Best time to visit:** March to early April.\r\n\r\n## 7. Olympic National Park, Washington\r\n\r\nSpring showcases multiple ecosystems awakening: rainforests grow even lusher with new growth, and wildlife becomes more active along the coastal sections.\r\n\r\n**Best time to visit:** April to June.\r\n\r\n## 8. Arches National Park, Utah\r\n\r\nThe moderate spring temperatures are perfect for exploring the park's iconic sandstone formations without the summer crowds and extreme heat.\r\n\r\n**Best time to visit:** April to May.\r\n\r\n## 9. Kenai Fjords National Park, Alaska\r\n\r\nLate spring marks the beginning of the visitor season, with calving glaciers and the return of marine wildlife like whales and puffins.\r\n\r\n**Best time to visit:** May to early June.\r\n\r\n## 10. Biscayne National Park, Florida\r\n\r\nBefore hurricane season and with winter crowds diminished, spring offers excellent conditions for exploring this underwater wonderland.\r\n\r\n**Best time to visit:** April to May.\r\n\r\n## Planning Your Spring Park Visit\r\n\r\nRemember that spring conditions can vary dramatically based on elevation and latitude. Always check current park conditions before your trip, as some areas may still be snow-covered or have limited access early in the season.\r\n\r\nMany parks also offer special ranger programs highlighting spring phenomena, so check event calendars when planning your visit.\r\n\r\nWhat's your favorite national park to visit in spring?

Whether you're a beginner with a smartphone or an experienced photographer with professional gear, these tips will help you take better wildlife photos while respecting these precious animals and their environments.\r\n\r\n## Preparation Is Key\r\n\r\n### Research Your Subjects\r\n\r\nBefore visiting a park, research what wildlife you might encounter. Understanding animal behavior patterns will significantly improve your chances of successful photography:\r\n\r\n- What time of day are they most active?\r\n- What habitats do they prefer?\r\n- What is their typical behavior during the season you're visiting?\r\n\r\nRanger stations, visitor centers, and park websites often provide information about recent wildlife sightings.\r\n\r\n### Pack the Right Gear\r\n\r\nWhile you don't need the most expensive equipment to capture great wildlife photos, certain items are essential:\r\n\r\n- **Telephoto lens**: A zoom lens (at least 200mm, preferably 300mm or longer) allows you to photograph animals from a safe and respectful distance.\r\n- **Tripod or monopod**: Stabilization is crucial, especially in low light or when using long lenses.\r\n- **Extra batteries and memory cards**: Wildlife photography opportunities can be unpredictable and plentiful.\r\n- **Weather protection**: A rain cover for your camera and lens can save your equipment during unexpected weather changes.\r\n\r\n## Field Techniques\r\n\r\n### The Golden Hours\r\n\r\nThe hours shortly after sunrise and before sunset provide the most flattering, warm light for wildlife photography. Many animals are also more active during these times.\r\n\r\n### Patience and Stillness\r\n\r\nWildlife photography requires patience. Find a promising location, get comfortable, stay quiet, and wait. Moving slowly and deliberately when you do need to reposition yourself will help avoid startling animals.\r\n\r\n### Focus on the Eyes\r\n\r\nIn almost all wildlife photos, the animal's eyes should be in sharp focus. This creates an emotional connection between the viewer and the subject.\r\n\r\n### Composition Matters\r\n\r\nConsider these composition tips:\r\n\r\n- **Rule of thirds**: Position your subject at the intersection points rather than the center of the frame.\r\n- **Space to move**: Leave space in the direction the animal is facing or moving.\r\n- **Environmental context**: Sometimes including habitat in your composition tells a more complete story than a tight portrait.\r\n- **Background awareness**: Look for clean, non-distracting backgrounds that help your subject stand out.\r\n\r\n## Ethical Wildlife Photography\r\n\r\n### Keep a Respectful Distance\r\n\r\nUse your zoom lens rather than approaching animals closely. Getting too close can stress wildlife, alter their behavior, or create dangerous situations.\r\n\r\nNational Park Service rules generally recommend staying at least:\r\n- 25 yards (23 meters) from most wildlife\r\n- 100 yards (91 meters) from predators like bears and wolves\r\n\r\n### Never Feed Wildlife\r\n\r\nFeeding wildlife damages their natural behaviors and can be harmful to their health. It's also prohibited in all national parks.\r\n\r\n### Stay on Designated Trails\r\n\r\nVenturing off-trail can damage fragile ecosystems and disturb wildlife habitats.\r\n\r\n### Know the Signs of Stress\r\n\r\nIf an animal changes its behavior because of your presence—stops feeding, stares at you, or moves away—you're too close. Back up slowly and give it more space.\r\n\r\n## Post-Processing Tips\r\n\r\nA few simple edits can elevate your wildlife images:\r\n\r\n1. **Crop thoughtfully**: Eliminate distracting elements while maintaining proper composition.\r\n2. **Adjust exposure**: Wildlife photography often involves challenging lighting conditions.\r\n3. **Sharpen selectively**: Apply sharpening to the animal (especially the eyes) rather than the entire image.\r\n4. **Be honest**: While basic adjustments are acceptable, avoid heavily manipulating images in ways that misrepresent natural behaviors or environments.\r\n\r\n## Share Responsibly\r\n\r\nWhen sharing your photos on social media or photography platforms:\r\n\r\n- Consider whether revealing specific locations might lead to over-visitation of sensitive areas.\r\n- Use your captions to educate others about wildlife conservation and ethical photography practices.\r\n- Follow park guidelines about commercial use if you plan to sell your images.\r\n\r\nRemember that the best wildlife photographers prioritize the well-being of their subjects above getting the \"perfect shot.\" By practicing ethical wildlife photography, you contribute to the conservation of these magnificent creatures and the preservation of their habitats for future generations to enjoy.\r\n\r\nWhat wildlife photography experiences have you had in national parks?

From relaxing day hikes suitable for families to challenging backcountry adventures, the park has something for every skill level. Here are our top picks for the best hiking experiences in America's first national park.\r\n\r\n## 1. Grand Prismatic Overlook Trail\r\n\r\n**Difficulty:** Easy to Moderate  \r\n**Distance:** 1.5 miles round trip  \r\n**Elevation Gain:** 200 feet  \r\n\r\nThe Grand Prismatic Overlook Trail offers one of the most rewarding views in the park with minimal effort. This relatively new trail takes you to a spectacular overlook of the Grand Prismatic Spring, the largest hot spring in the United States and the third largest in the world.\r\n\r\nFrom this elevated vantage point, you'll be able to appreciate the spring's remarkable rainbow colors in a way that's impossible from the boardwalks at ground level. The trail begins from the Fairy Falls parking area and gradually climbs a hillside to the overlook.\r\n\r\n**Tip:** Visit on a sunny day with light winds for the best visibility of the spring's vibrant colors.\r\n\r\n## 2. Mount Washburn Trail\r\n\r\n**Difficulty:** Moderate to Challenging  \r\n**Distance:** 6.4 miles round trip (from Dunraven Pass) or 5 miles round trip (from Chittenden Road)  \r\n**Elevation Gain:** 1,400 feet  \r\n\r\nOne of the most popular hikes in Yellowstone, Mount Washburn offers spectacular panoramic views of the park from its 10,243-foot summit. On clear days, you can see the Grand Tetons to the south, and the views of Yellowstone's vast landscape are unparalleled.\r\n\r\nThe trail follows an old road to a fire lookout at the summit, where you'll often spot bighorn sheep along the way. While the hike requires some stamina, the gradual incline makes it manageable for most hikers in good physical condition.\r\n\r\n**Tip:** Start early to avoid afternoon thunderstorms, which are common in summer months. Bring plenty of water as there are no water sources along the trail.\r\n\r\n## 3. Fairy Falls Trail\r\n\r\n**Difficulty:** Easy  \r\n**Distance:** 5 miles round trip  \r\n**Elevation Gain:** 200 feet  \r\n\r\nFairy Falls is one of Yellowstone's most magnificent waterfalls, and the hike to reach it is relatively flat and accessible for most ability levels. The 200-foot waterfall cascades down a rock cliff face, creating a magical scene that's perfect for photography.\r\n\r\nThe trail begins at the same parking area as the Grand Prismatic Overlook Trail, making it easy to combine both hikes in a single day. After viewing the iconic hot spring from above, continue on the flat path through a lodgepole pine forest to reach the falls.\r\n\r\n**Tip:** For an added adventure, take the short spur trail to Imperial Geyser after visiting Fairy Falls.\r\n\r\n## 4. Bunsen Peak Trail\r\n\r\n**Difficulty:** Moderate  \r\n**Distance:** 4.2 miles round trip  \r\n**Elevation Gain:** 1,300 feet  \r\n\r\nBunsen Peak provides a fantastic half-day hiking experience with tremendous views of the Mammoth Hot Springs area and surrounding mountains. Named after the German chemist who invented the Bunsen burner, this dormant volcano offers a good workout with a big scenic payoff.\r\n\r\nThe trail switchbacks up the mountain through forests and open slopes, with increasingly impressive views as you climb. The summit provides a 360-degree panorama of Yellowstone's northern region.\r\n\r\n**Tip:** Look for wildlife such as elk and mule deer in the meadows below as you ascend.\r\n\r\n## 5. Lamar River Trail\r\n\r\n**Difficulty:** Moderate  \r\n**Distance:** Variable (up to 12 miles round trip)  \r\n**Elevation Gain:** 300 feet  \r\n\r\nFor wildlife viewing combined with beautiful riverside scenery, the Lamar River Trail is hard to beat. Located in the wildlife-rich Lamar Valley, often called \"America's Serengeti,\" this trail offers excellent opportunities to spot bison, pronghorn, eagles, and possibly even wolves or bears (from a safe distance).\r\n\r\nThe full trail extends for many miles, but you can turn around at any point, making it adaptable to your available time and energy level. The terrain is relatively easy, following the Lamar River through open meadows and scattered pine forests.\r\n\r\n**Tip:** Bring binoculars and go early in the morning or late in the evening for the best wildlife viewing opportunities.\r\n\r\n## Preparing for Your Yellowstone Hike\r\n\r\nBefore setting out on any trail in Yellowstone, keep these essential tips in mind:\r\n\r\n- **Carry bear spray** and know how to use it\r\n- Pack plenty of **water and high-energy snacks**\r\n- Be prepared for **rapidly changing weather conditions**\r\n- Stay on **designated trails** to protect yourself and the fragile ecosystem\r\n- **Leave No Trace** by packing out all trash\r\n- Check with **visitor centers** for current trail conditions and closures\r\n\r\nYellowstone's trail system allows visitors to experience the park's remarkable landscapes and diverse ecosystems up close. From the hydrothermal features to mountain vistas and wildlife-filled valleys, these five hikes showcase the best that America's first national park has to offer.\r\n\r\nWhat's your favorite trail in Yellowstone?

From massive bison roaming across open plains to elusive mountain lions prowling through forests, these protected areas offer some of the best opportunities for animal sightings in North America. Here's our guide to the top parks for wildlife enthusiasts and some tips for responsible viewing.\r\n\r\n## Best National Parks for Wildlife Watching\r\n\r\n### 1. Yellowstone National Park\r\n\r\n**Star Species:** Wolves, bison, grizzly bears, elk, moose, pronghorn, black bears\r\n\r\nKnown as America's Serengeti, Yellowstone's Lamar Valley is widely considered the best wildlife watching destination in North America. The reintroduction of wolves in the 1990s restored the natural ecosystem, creating a complete predator-prey dynamic that visitors can observe. Early mornings in the Lamar and Hayden Valleys offer the best chances to see large mammals, including the park's famous bison herds, which can number in the thousands.\r\n\r\n**Viewing Tip:** Bring a spotting scope or powerful binoculars, especially for wolf watching. The Lamar Valley at dawn is prime time for predator activity.\r\n\r\n### 2. Everglades National Park\r\n\r\n**Star Species:** American alligators, manatees, dolphins, panthers, roseate spoonbills, wood storks\r\n\r\nThis unique ecosystem is a paradise for bird watchers and reptile enthusiasts. The Anhinga Trail is famous for up-close alligator sightings, while the Shark Valley area offers abundant wildlife viewing from its observation tower. The park's mangrove waterways provide sanctuary for manatees and dolphins, best spotted during a kayak tour of the Ten Thousand Islands area.\r\n\r\n**Viewing Tip:** Winter (December through April) is the dry season and offers the best wildlife concentration around remaining water sources.\r\n\r\n### 3. Grand Teton National Park\r\n\r\n**Star Species:** Moose, bison, elk, black bears, grizzly bears, beavers, bald eagles\r\n\r\nWith the dramatic Teton Range as a backdrop, wildlife viewing here is both productive and photogenic. Moose are frequently spotted in willow flats and along the Snake River. Oxbow Bend is a hotspot for moose, beaver, and waterfowl, especially at sunrise and sunset.\r\n\r\n**Viewing Tip:** The Mormon Row area is excellent for combining historic barn photography with bison sightings during summer months.\r\n\r\n### 4. Olympic National Park\r\n\r\n**Star Species:** Roosevelt elk, black bears, mountain goats, sea otters, gray whales, seals, sea lions\r\n\r\nOlympic's diverse ecosystems—from glaciated mountains to old-growth rainforests to wild coastlines—harbor an incredible variety of wildlife. The Hoh Rain Forest is prime Roosevelt elk territory, while the coastal portions of the park offer tidepooling and marine mammal sightings.\r\n\r\n**Viewing Tip:** Visit the Kalaloch and Ruby Beach areas during low tide for tidepooling, and scan the water for whales during their spring migration (March-May).\r\n\r\n### 5. Denali National Park\r\n\r\n**Star Species:** Grizzly bears, wolves, moose, caribou, Dall sheep, golden eagles, foxes\r\n\r\nWith limited road access and vast wilderness, Denali provides some of the most authentic wildlife viewing experiences. The park's transit buses offer an excellent platform for spotting animals across the open tundra landscape.\r\n\r\n**Viewing Tip:** The Eielson Visitor Center area (mile 66 on the park road) offers some of the highest concentrations of grizzly bear sightings.\r\n\r\n## Wildlife Watching Tips\r\n\r\n### 1. Timing Is Everything\r\n\r\nMost animals are most active at dawn and dusk—periods photographers call \"the golden hours.\" Plan your wildlife excursions for early morning or late afternoon for the best viewing opportunities and optimal lighting for photography.\r\n\r\n### 2. Learn Proper Distance Guidelines\r\n\r\nDifferent parks have different distance requirements, but the general rules are:\r\n- Stay at least 100 yards (91 meters) from bears and wolves\r\n- Stay at least 25 yards (23 meters) from all other wildlife\r\n- Never approach wildlife—use binoculars or telephoto lenses instead\r\n\r\n### 3. Look for Signs\r\n\r\nLearn to recognize animal tracks, scat, and other signs like rubbed trees, wallows, or scrapes. These indicators can help you determine which animals frequent an area even if you don't see them immediately.\r\n\r\n### 4. Be Patient and Quiet\r\n\r\nWildlife viewing rewards patience. Find a promising spot with good visibility, sit quietly, and wait. Many experienced wildlife watchers bring a folding stool and spend hours in one location.\r\n\r\n### 5. Bring the Right Gear\r\n\r\nEssential wildlife watching equipment includes:\r\n- Binoculars (8x42 or 10x42 are recommended)\r\n- Spotting scope for distant viewing\r\n- Field guide for identification\r\n- Camera with telephoto lens\r\n- Comfortable, weather-appropriate clothing in neutral colors\r\n\r\n### 6. Practice Ethical Wildlife Photography\r\n\r\n- Never bait, call, or otherwise lure animals\r\n- Don't use flash photography around wildlife\r\n- Avoid disturbing an animal's natural behavior\r\n- Never put yourself or wildlife at risk for a photo\r\n\r\n### 7. Join a Ranger Program\r\n\r\nMany parks offer ranger-led wildlife viewing excursions. These programs provide expert guidance, increase your chances of spotting animals, and ensure you're viewing wildlife safely and responsibly.\r\n\r\n## Responsible Wildlife Watching\r\n\r\nRemember that we are visitors in these animals' homes.
