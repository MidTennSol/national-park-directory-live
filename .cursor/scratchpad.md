# National Park Directory - Sitemap Integration Issue Resolution

## Background and Motivation
The project is experiencing a critical integrated issue where fixing the sitemap breaks the live site and vice versa. This creates a continuous loop of fixes that destabilize each other. The root cause appears to be a complex interaction between Astro's build process, the sitemap generation plugin, and Netlify's deployment pipeline.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Current Configuration Analysis
1. **Astro Setup**
   - Using @astrojs/sitemap integration
   - Site URL configured correctly as 'https://nationalparkdirectory.com'
   - Basic sitemap configuration present with changefreq and priority
   - Filter configured to exclude 404 pages

2. **Netlify Setup**
   - Custom build command using `build-with-rollup-fix.sh`
   - Publishing from `dist` directory
   - Multiple header rules for caching
   - Complex redirect rules for blog images
   - Debug plugin present for blog content issues

### Identified Risk Areas
1. **Build Process Timing**
   - Sitemap generation may occur at wrong phase of build process
   - Potential race conditions between static file generation and sitemap creation
   - Custom build script may affect normal Astro build flow

2. **File Output Location**
   - Uncertainty about whether sitemap.xml is properly included in dist/ folder
   - Possible conflicts between static file handling and dynamic routes

3. **Netlify Configuration**
   - Multiple redirects and header rules may interfere with sitemap serving
   - Cache control headers might affect sitemap availability
   - Debug plugin could potentially interfere with normal build flow

   - Success Criteria: Clear identification of conflict point in pipeline

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. **Build Process Optimization**
   - [ ] Modify build script to ensure proper phase ordering
   - [ ] Add explicit sitemap generation step if needed
   - [ ] Verify static file handling in build pipeline
   - Success Criteria: Stable build process with predictable output

2. **Configuration Updates**

   - [ ] Update deployment process if needed
   - Success Criteria: Reliable deployment with both site and sitemap working

### Phase 3: Verification and Stabilization
1. **Testing Protocol**
   - [ ] Test local build process
   - [ ] Verify preview deployment
   - [ ] Confirm production deployment
   - Success Criteria: All environments working correctly

2. **Monitoring Implementation**
   - [ ] Add build-time checks for sitemap
   - [ ] Implement deployment verification
   - [ ] Create monitoring for sitemap availability
   - Success Criteria: Automated verification system in place

3. **Documentation and Prevention**
   - [ ] Document final working configuration
   - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
   - [ ] Add configuration validation checks
   - Success Criteria: Complete documentation and prevention measures

## Project Status Board
- 游릭 Phase 1: Done
- 游릭 Phase 2: Done
- 游리 Phase 3: In Progress

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Phase 1 (Google Maps): Issue was .env file encoding (UTF-16 LE). Solution: convert to UTF-8. Map now works and API key is read. Proceeding to Phase 2 (Hero Image System).
- Phase 2 (Hero Image): Centralized hero image config and reusable component implemented for all main pages. Proceeding to Phase 3 (SEO Enhancement).

## Lessons
1. Integrated issues require holistic solutions - fixing individual symptoms leads to regression cycles
2. Build pipeline order and timing is critical for static file generation
3. Configuration conflicts can create subtle deployment issues
4. Proper monitoring and verification steps are essential for stability
