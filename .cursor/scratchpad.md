# National Park Directory - Sitemap Integration Issue Resolution

## Background and Motivation
The project is experiencing a critical integrated issue where fixing the sitemap breaks the live site and vice versa. This creates a continuous loop of fixes that destabilize each other. The root cause appears to be a complex interaction between Astro's build process, the sitemap generation plugin, and Netlify's deployment pipeline.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Current Configuration Analysis
1. **Astro Setup**
   - Using @astrojs/sitemap integration
   - Site URL configured correctly as 'https://nationalparkdirectory.com'
   - Basic sitemap configuration present with changefreq and priority
   - Filter configured to exclude 404 pages

2. **Netlify Setup**
   - Custom build command using `build-with-rollup-fix.sh`
   - Publishing from `dist` directory
   - Multiple header rules for caching
   - Complex redirect rules for blog images
   - Debug plugin present for blog content issues

### Identified Risk Areas
1. **Build Process Timing**
   - Sitemap generation may occur at wrong phase of build process
   - Potential race conditions between static file generation and sitemap creation
   - Custom build script may affect normal Astro build flow

2. **File Output Location**
   - Uncertainty about whether sitemap.xml is properly included in dist/ folder
   - Possible conflicts between static file handling and dynamic routes

3. **Netlify Configuration**
   - Multiple redirects and header rules may interfere with sitemap serving
   - Cache control headers might affect sitemap availability
   - Debug plugin could potentially interfere with normal build flow

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Investigation and Diagnosis
1. **Build Output Analysis**
   - [ ] Examine local build output structure
   - [ ] Verify sitemap.xml generation timing and location
   - [ ] Check for any build warnings or errors related to static file generation
   - Success Criteria: Clear understanding of where and when sitemap.xml is generated

2. **Configuration Audit**
   - [ ] Review all Astro config options affecting static file generation
   - [ ] Audit Netlify configuration for potential conflicts
   - [ ] Examine build script for potential interference with sitemap generation
   - Success Criteria: Complete map of all configuration points affecting sitemap

3. **Deployment Process Analysis**
   - [ ] Monitor complete build and deploy process
   - [ ] Track sitemap.xml through entire pipeline
   - [ ] Identify exact point where site/sitemap conflict occurs
   - Success Criteria: Clear identification of conflict point in pipeline

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. **Build Process Optimization**
   - [ ] Modify build script to ensure proper phase ordering
   - [ ] Add explicit sitemap generation step if needed
   - [ ] Verify static file handling in build pipeline
   - Success Criteria: Stable build process with predictable output

2. **Configuration Updates**
   - [ ] Update Astro sitemap configuration based on findings
   - [ ] Adjust Netlify configuration to properly handle sitemap
   - [ ] Modify header/redirect rules if necessary
   - Success Criteria: Clean configuration without conflicting rules

3. **Deployment Pipeline Adjustment**
   - [ ] Implement any necessary build phase changes
   - [ ] Add verification steps for sitemap presence
   - [ ] Update deployment process if needed
   - Success Criteria: Reliable deployment with both site and sitemap working

### Phase 3: Verification and Stabilization
1. **Testing Protocol**
   - [ ] Test local build process
   - [ ] Verify preview deployment
   - [ ] Confirm production deployment
   - Success Criteria: All environments working correctly

2. **Monitoring Implementation**
   - [ ] Add build-time checks for sitemap
   - [ ] Implement deployment verification
   - [ ] Create monitoring for sitemap availability
   - Success Criteria: Automated verification system in place

3. **Documentation and Prevention**
   - [ ] Document final working configuration
   - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
   - [ ] Add configuration validation checks
   - Success Criteria: Complete documentation and prevention measures
