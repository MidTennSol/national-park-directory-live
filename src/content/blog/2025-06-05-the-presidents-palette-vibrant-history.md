## Discover a Turning Point in History 
At the epicenter of Buffalo, New York's rich historical tapestry nestles the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site; where one transformative presidency was born. From an unassuming house on Delaware Avenue, Teddy Roosevelt launched an era that undoubtedly shaped America’s course. Visit Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site and witness first-hand where a epoch-making event unfolded - the hasty and emotionally-charged inauguration of President Theodore Roosevelt following the assassination of William McKinley in 1901. 

This guide invites you to unearth secrets preserved within these walls; tales of courage against adversity, political evolution sparked by tragedy, and pivotal decisions that shaped this nation's future. This relic is not just unique because it witnessed power’s abrupt shift but because it chronicles an extraordinary period in American history when ordinary citizens gained protection and big businesses came under control. With events spanning art to military engagements echoing through its corridors, prepare for more than just a casual walk through time.

## The President's Palette: Vibrant History
On September 14, 1901, an unlikely room in Buffalo’s Ansley Wilcox House evolved into the stage for one of America’s most critical presidential inaugurations. Following President McKinley’s death from Leon Czolgosz’s fatal bullet wounds, Vice President Theodore Roosevelt was hastily sworn in as America's 26th President here.

This house bears marks from diverse timelines. Built around 1839 as military offices during the Mexican-American War, it transformed into a private residence in 1845 when prominent Buffalo citizen Albert P. Brisbane moved in, followed by Ansley Wilcox's possession in 1883. It thus combines architectural styles of different eras and cultures, mirrored in its Greek revival style and Victorian embellishments.
