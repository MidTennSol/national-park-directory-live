## **Introduction**

Shiloh National Military Park in Memphis, Tennessee and Mississippi is not your average national park - it's an outdoor museum, a wildlife preserve, and most importantly, hallowed grounds that recall one of the bloodiest battles in American Civil War history. 

**Historical/Cultural/Geological Background**

Rich with cultural and historical significance, Shiloh was named after Shiloh Methodist Church near Pittsburg Landing on the Tennessee River's west bank where Union forces gathered before their confrontation with Confederate soldiers in April 1862. The area became known as "The Battle of Pittsburg Landing" or simply "Shiloh." Today, it is home to over 4,000 acres of preserved land including battlegrounds, cemeteries, monuments, and historic buildings. Apart from its rich human history, this park also showcases stunning geological features like steep bluffs plunging down into meandering riverbanks.

**Activities Guide**

While visiting Shiloh National Military Park isn't about simple recreations, there are plenty to immerse oneself into the extensive history or enjoy wildlife sightings. Visitors can check out exhibits at the Visitor Center or view short films about the battle. Self-guided tours through miles of interpretive trails lead to significant spots like Bloody Pond or General Johnston's last bivouac. For birdwatchers and photographers alike, the park's diverse ecosystems serve as refuge for a variety of wildlife. Monthly living history programs held near Shiloh Indian Mounds also offer a glimpse into prehistoric Native American life.

**Visitor Information**

Shiloh National Military Park is open year-round. For detailed schedules, consult the park's official website. Visitors may purchase entry passes at the Visitor Center. Law mandates that visitors respect and protect all historical features – remember, these are national treasures that require preservation for generations to come.

**Tips for Different Visitors**

Families can make their visit educational with Junior Ranger Program activities available in the Visitor Center. Seniors or people with mobility issues might consider auto-tours covering over fourteen miles through significant sights, while outdoor enthusiasts might opt for hiking and picnicking in designated areas. Pet lovers will be relieved to hear pets on leashes are allowed in public areas excluding buildings.

**Regional Context**

Nestled within a region bursting with history and culture, Shiloh National Military Park pairs perfectly with nearby attractions like Corinth Civil War Interpretive Center - a museum about war’s impact on local population; or Tennessee River Museum - housing substantial civil war naval exhibits. In addition, Memphis promises mouth-watering southern barbecues and rich music history waiting to be explored.
