Introduction:
Welcome to Cedar Creek & Belle Grove National Historical Park, situated in the scenic Shenandoah Valley in Winchester, Virginia. Considered a gem among national parks due to its illustrious past and gorgeous landscape, this park offers visitors an opportunity to explore both American history and mother nature’s bounty at once. Cascading waters of Cedar Creek meander through rolling hills while centuries-old trees form a canopy of tranquillity above. Yet beneath this serene façade lies fierce tales of battles fought and a gripping narrative of plantation-life spanning over 200 years.

Historical/Cultural/Geological Background:
This park is home to some pivotal moments in American history - most notably the Battle of Cedar Creek which unfolded here in October 1864 during the American Civil War. This clash formed the crux of Union’s victory in The Shenandoah Valley Campaigns that was instrumental in President Lincoln's re-election. A stroll across these fields evokes vivid imagery of valiant soldiers battling amidst chaos.

Equally intriguing is the Belle Grove Plantation House. Built-in 1797 by Major Isaac Hite Jr., a Revolutionary War veteran, it stands as an emblem of late 18th-century slave-plantation life with deep roots into Native American history dating back seven millennia.

Activities Guide:
A range of immersive activities awaits visitors in this park. History buffs can attend ranger-guided tours recounting tales from America's past while wandering around battlefield landscapes or exploring the grandeur inside Belle Grove mansion.

For nature lovers, hiking trails abound. The Morning Meadow walk is particularly delightful. During spring and summer, wildflowers burst into myriad hues attracting a plethora of wildlife including golden finches and monarch butterflies.
