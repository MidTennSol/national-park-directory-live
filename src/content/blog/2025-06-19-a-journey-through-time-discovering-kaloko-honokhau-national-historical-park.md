### **Introduction**
There are places that possess an uncanny ability to transport you to another time. The Kaloko-Honokōhau National Historical Park, located along the sunny Kona coast of Big Island, Hawaii, is one such place. This pristine sanctuary is a splendid blend of historical relevance with stunning natural beauty, making it an incredible destination for history buffs and nature lovers alike.

### **Historical/Cultural/Geological Background**
Founded in 1978, the park covers over 1160 acres and is laden with petroglyphs (rock carvings), ancient home sites, royal fish ponds, religious temples (heiau) and trails laid by native Hawaiians centuries ago. The park takes its name from two separate words - 'Kaloko' referring to the fishpond in the northern reach of the park and 'Honokōhau', referencing both the smaller fishpond and settlement in the southern part.

Its establishment aimed not merely to conserve these historic structures but also to pay tribute to Native Hawaiian ancestors’ unique expertise in adapting to their environment. The monumental fishponds stand testament to this ingenuity, demonstrating their advanced understanding of tidal movements and fish breeding cycles.

### **Activities Guide**
From hiking amidst volcanic landscapes to bird-watching or exploring marine life during snorkeling sessions at Honokōhau Harbor; there's something for everyone here!

**Hiking:** The park offers two primary trails - the Ala Hele Ike Hawai'i Trail and the Ala Kahakai trail. The former introduces you to numerous archeological sites while the latter provides breathtaking coastal views.

**Wildlife Spotting:** You could spot green sea turtles (honu), monk seals, native birds, and in winter months, even humpback whales!

**Snorkeling:** Honokōhau Harbor located within the park is a snorkeler’s paradise.
