Historical/Cultural/Geological Background:
Established in 1950, Greenbelt Park stands as one deliberate project under President Roosevelt's New Deal program to create jobs during The Great Depression.

Spread over an impressive 1,176 acres; others may call it 'Maryland’s Backyard,' but we prefer to dub it an emerald thrill ride – an evergreen playground suspended between yesterday and today.
