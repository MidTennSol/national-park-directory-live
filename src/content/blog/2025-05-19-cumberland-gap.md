## Best Time to Visit

Spring and fall are ideal for comfortable weather and stunning foliage. Fall especially paints the mountains with rich oranges and reds—perfect for photos and scenic drives. Summer brings lush greenery, while winter offers solitude and misty views.

## Top Things to Do in Cumberland Gap

### 1. Hike to the Pinnacle Overlook
Arguably the most iconic view in the park, the Pinnacle Overlook sits 2,440 feet above sea level. From here, you can gaze across **all three states**. It’s accessible by car or a moderate hike.

### 2. Walk in the Footsteps of Pioneers
The **Wilderness Road Trail** traces the path once used by Daniel Boone and thousands of westward settlers. The trail includes interpretive signs that share the history of early American expansion.

### 3. Explore Gap Cave
Guided cave tours reveal breathtaking underground formations and Civil War-era graffiti. Book in advance, as tours often fill up during peak season.

### 4. Visit the Hensley Settlement
Accessible by a strenuous hike or seasonal shuttle, this remote mountain community offers a preserved glimpse into Appalachian life in the early 20th century.

### 5. Wildlife Watching and Photography
Deer, black bears, wild turkeys, and songbirds are common throughout the park. Bring your binoculars and a good lens—you’ll likely spot some surprises along the trails.

## Camping & Accommodations

While the park itself doesn’t offer frontcountry campgrounds, nearby **Wilderness Road Campground** and private options in Middlesboro or Cumberland Gap, TN, provide plenty of lodging and camping possibilities. Backcountry camping is available with a permit.
