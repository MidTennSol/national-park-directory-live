## Historic Footprints: Revolutionary Echoes

Strap yourself into this time capsule—you're about to recreate the Southern Campaign of the American Revolution. Our story begins in 1781, where a significant conflict unfolded on March 15th beneath North Carolina's cloud-laden sky.

The protagonists are two formidable forces—General Nathanael Greene leading his Continental troops and the indomitable British Army directed by Lord Charles Cornwallis. This historic clash became a turning point in America's quest for independence, leaving an undeniable mark on our country's narrative.

This battle saw Greene's decidedly outnumbered forces hold their ground against Cornwallis' superior unit, resulting in a Pyrrhic victory for the British. In essence, Britain won the battle but lost the war as this encounter exhausted their resources considerably—a precursor to their eventual surrender at Yorktown seven months later.

Today, this sacred battleground proudly showcases over thirty memorials and markers scattered across its land—a tangible testament to bravery and sacrifice made over two centuries ago. Immerse yourself into the historical narrative through guided tours or self-paced exploration and let history come alive at Guilford Courthouse National Military Park.
