## Scenic Stories: A Walk through History 

Colonial National Historical Park serves as an open-air museum chronicling vivid stories of early colonization. On May 13, 1607, over a decade before Plymouth was formed, Jamestown emerged as North America's first permanent English settlement. Within its confines European, African and Virginia Indian cultures converged creating a rich tapestry of diversity and evolution that continues to influence modern America.

About 174 years after Jamestown’s establishment occurred one of history's most critical turning points - The Battle of Yorktown. Here on October 19, 1781, American and French forces sealed the fate of the Revolutionary War by defeating the British troops. A victory that ultimately led to America’s independence from Great Britain.

Embedded within these grand tales are personalities and events that add depth to our understanding of American history; Captain John Smith’s leadership and Pocahontas’ pivotal role in establishing peace between Native Americans and English settlers, or General George Washington's contribution at Yorktown Battlefield. The park is a testament to their resilience, ambition, and fortitude.
