Its seven colossal mounds dating back to the Mississippian era. Embark on our guide as we go beneath its surface and unearth its deep-rooted past and wealth of unexplored treasures.

## Untold Heritage: Echoes from the Earth
Ocmulgee Mounds has been at the epicentre of several ancient civilizations - stitched together by threads spun over generations by different cultures – each contributing uniquely to what we see today. Archaeologists believe hunting bands first wandered here during the Paleo-Indian period chasing Ice Age mammals. Then around 900 CE began the Mississippian Period – marked by construction for their elite class - some which still stand tall, unyielding against the test of time.

The park not only includes the earthwork marvels but also the Lamar Site - a major political and cultural center during the Mississippian era. This seamless mix of natural beauty and cultural heritage draws parallels to other regional establishments like Kolomoki Mounds in Georgia, making Ocmulgee an awe-inspiring site to experience.
