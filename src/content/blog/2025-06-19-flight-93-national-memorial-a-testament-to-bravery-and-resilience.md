## **Introduction**

## **Historical/Cultural/Geological Background**
United Airlines Flight 93 was one of the four flights hijacked by terrorists during the tragic events of September 11th. Despite realizing they were part of a larger plot after speaking with family members through airphones, the brave passengers banded together to regain control from their captors. 

Their collective act prevented further destruction as their flight plunged into a field near Shanksville instead of its intended target—presumably either the United States Capitol or White House. Today, this site symbolizes their undying spirit embodied within forty groves each consisting forty trees surrounding a memorial plaza along the crash trajectory.

## **Activities Guide**
Navigating through solemnity can be challenging yet enriching here at Flight 93 National Memorial. Pay your respects at 'The Wall Of Names'—a white marble wall inscribed with names of those aboard Flight 93 situated along final flight path. Take an enlightening walk around the Visitor Center, providing a wealth of context and interpretation of the Flight 93 story through multimedia presentations and exhibits.

Take in the powerful symbolism of the Memorial Plaza that marks the edge of the crash site. The Sacred Ground is strictly restricted for visits only by family members of those honored. Quietly admire its serene beauty from one of the overlooks designed specifically for reflection.

## **Visitor Information**
The memorial park remains open every day year-round from sunrise to sunset, with no admission fee except during annual remembrance ceremonies. Guided tours are available but require advanced reservations. Use the provided digital app for self-given tours during your visit.
