# 10 Best National Parks to Visit in Spring

Spring is one of the most magical times to experience America's national parks. As winter's grip loosens, parks come alive with blooming wildflowers, gushing waterfalls, and active wildlife. Here are our top recommendations for spring visits.

## 1. Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee/North Carolina

## Planning Your Spring Park Visit

Remember that spring conditions can vary dramatically based on elevation and latitude. Always check current park conditions before your trip, as some areas may still be snow-covered or have limited access early in the season.

Many parks also offer special ranger programs highlighting spring phenomena, so check event calendars when planning your visit.
