## **Introduction**

The tour begins at 2038 Auburn Avenue, where stands the grandiose, Greek-revival-style house built by Taft's father. Constructed in 1857 on Mount Auburn’s slopes, this stately home provides a panoramic view of downtown Cincinnati. Delve deep into American history as you embark on a journey transporting you back to Taft’s life and his contributions that have significantly shaped modern America.

## **Historical/Cultural/Geological Background**

William H. Taft was born here in 1857 into a family deeply invested in law and public service. His father Alphonso served under Ulysses S. Grant as Secretary of War and Attorney General. Surrounded by such influential figures molded young William's interest in law and politics, ultimately leading him to hold dual distinctive posts unheard-of before or since.

Designated as a national historic site October 5th, 1969 – this preservation offers visitors an enlightening encounter with authentic artifacts shedding light on Taft’s political philosophy, his presidency (1909 -1913), his time as Chief Justice (1921-1930), and his enduring legacy.

## **Activities Guide**

Engage in hands-on exhibits that help you experience law practices during Taft's time. Participate in exciting seasonal educational programs geared towards different age groups, ranging from mock trials to interpretive sessions about days gone by.

## **Visitor Information**

This National Park Service maintained site is open Wednesday through Sunday from 8:00 am to 4:15 pm. Admission is free but tour sizes are limited, making it imperative to reserve your spot well ahead of your visit especially on weekends or holidays. Visitors must check-in at the visitor center where they receive their parking pass and entry ticket.

## **Tips for Different Visitors**

While the home tour might fascinate history buffs and adults, it may lack similar engagement for young children. Fortunately, the education center offers interactive displays more apt for younger audiences. Also, poise yourself for a climb as the historic house is four stories tall with multiple staircases involved.

If visiting during summertime, don't forget sunscreen and hats as there's minimal shade provided on the grounds outside the buildings.

## **Regional Context**

Cincinnati is often overlooked as just an industrial city but it’s an underestimated gem retaining its historical charm alongside modern development. After visiting the Taft Historical Site, consider exploring Cincinnati - wander along its beautiful riverfront parks, indulge in its craft-brewery scene or dive into other historically culturally rich places like Cincinnati Museum Center or Music Hall; creating an enriching Ohioan journey.

## **Conclusion**

Whether you're a history enthusiast, teacher looking for educational experiences or simply a family seeking to spend quality time learning together - William Howard Taft National Historic Site provides an unparalleled encounter with America's past and one man’s enormous role within it.
