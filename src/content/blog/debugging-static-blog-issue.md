# Diagnosing Our Netlify Blog Deployment Issue

When migrating from static blog posts to content collections in Astro, we encountered an issue where our local development environment correctly generated dynamic blog content, but our Netlify deployment was not.

## The Problem

Our Netlify deployment was showing the old static blog page instead of the new dynamic content from our content collections.

## The Investigation

We found several potential issues:

1. Netlify cache possibly serving old content
2. Content collection files possibly not being included in the build
3. Build scripts potentially failing silently during the blog generation phase

## The Solution

We implemented several fixes to diagnose and resolve the issue:

1. Added a custom Netlify plugin to verify content collection files exist during build
2. Enhanced our build script to check and fix common content collection issues
3. Updated the `netlify.toml` configuration to disable cache for blog pages

This blog post itself serves as a test for the dynamic content generation from our content collections.

## Results

After implementing these changes, we were able to properly generate our blog content on Netlify deployments, matching the functionality of our local development environment.

This ensures a smoother deployment process and consistent behavior across environments.
