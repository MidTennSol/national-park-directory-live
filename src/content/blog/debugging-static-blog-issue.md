# Debugging Static Blog Issue

This is a test post created to verify that the blog content collection is working properly after deployment.

## What's Happening?

We've been experiencing an issue where the blog pages on the live site are showing the old static content instead of the new content from the Astro content collection.

## Possible Causes

1. Build configuration issues
2. Caching problems
3. Routing conflicts
4. Content collection not being properly processed

## Next Steps

If this post appears on the live site, it confirms that the content collection is working correctly. If not, we'll need to investigate further.

Here's a test image to make sure the images are being processed correctly:

## Conclusion

This post should help us verify if the blog system is functioning as expected.
