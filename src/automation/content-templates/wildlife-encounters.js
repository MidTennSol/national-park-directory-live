### The Golden Triangle
The area between the visitor center, main trail system, and water features consistently offers the best wildlife viewing opportunities. This zone combines multiple habitat types and reliable water sources that attract diverse species.

### Water Features
Rivers, lakes, and streams serve as wildlife magnets, especially during dry seasons. Animals come to drink, hunt, and cool off, making these areas excellent for patient observers.

### Transition Zones
The edges between different habitats (forest meets meadow, water meets land) are particularly productive for wildlife viewing. These "edge effects" concentrate animal activity.

### Elevated Viewpoints
High ground provides excellent vantage points for spotting wildlife across large areas. Bring binoculars to scan distant meadows and valleys.

## Best Viewing Strategies

### Patience is Key
The most successful wildlife watchers arrive early, stay late, and remain patient. Animals operate on their own schedules, not ours.

### Move Slowly and Quietly
Quick movements and loud noises will send animals fleeing. Practice moving deliberately and speaking in whispers.

### Use Your Senses
Listen for calls, rustling, and other sounds. Watch for movement, tracks, and signs of recent animal activity.`;

  return `## Essential Wildlife Safety

### The Golden Rules
1. **Maintain Safe Distances:** Use the "thumb rule" - if your outstretched thumb doesn't cover the entire animal, you're too close
2. **Never Feed Wildlife:** Human food is harmful to animals and creates dangerous dependencies
3. **Stay on Designated Trails:** Protect both yourself and sensitive habitats
4. **Make Noise in Dense Areas:** Alert animals to your presence to avoid surprise encounters

### Specific Safety Protocols

#### Large Mammal Encounters
- If you encounter large mammals, do not run
- Back away slowly while facing the animal
- Make yourself appear larger by raising your arms
- Speak in a calm, low voice

#### Group Safety
- Stay together as a group, especially with children
- Designate someone to watch for approaching animals
- Have an emergency plan and know where the nearest help is located

### Emergency Preparedness
- Carry a whistle or other noise maker
- Know the location of the nearest ranger station
- Have a first aid kit for minor injuries
- Understand basic animal behavior to predict reactions`;

function generatePhotographyTips(park) {
  return `## Capturing Amazing Wildlife Photos

### Equipment Essentials
- **Telephoto Lens:** Essential for maintaining safe distances
- **Tripod:** Stabilizes shots during low-light conditions
- **Extra Batteries:** Cold weather drains batteries quickly
- **Memory Cards:** Bring more than you think you'll need

### Technique Tips
- **Patience Over Positioning:** Wait for natural behaviors rather than forcing shots
- **Focus on Eyes:** Sharp eyes make compelling wildlife photographs
- **Capture Behavior:** Action shots tell better stories than static poses
- **Use Natural Light:** Golden hour provides the most flattering lighting

### Ethical Photography
- Animal welfare comes before the perfect shot
- Don't disturb animals for photos
- Respect nesting and feeding areas
- Follow all park photography regulations`;
