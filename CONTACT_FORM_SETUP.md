Your contact form is now functional! Here's how to set up email delivery:

## Current Status ✅

## Email Service Options

### Option 1: Resend (Recommended) 🚀

1. **Sign up for Resend**: Visit [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. **Get API key**: Create a new API key in your dashboard
3. **Add to environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # .env
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. **Update the API endpoint**: Uncomment the Resend code in `src/pages/api/contact.ts`
5. **Install dependency**:
   ```bash
   npm install resend
   ```

### Option 2: EmailJS (Client-side) 📧

1. **Sign up for EmailJS**: Visit [emailjs.com](https://emailjs.com)
2. **Create email template** in your dashboard
3. **Add EmailJS to your contact form**:
   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@emailjs/browser@3/dist/email.min.js"></script>
   ```

### Option 3: Formspree (Easiest) 📝

1. **Sign up for Formspree**: Visit [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)

## Current Behavior

2. **Visit**: `http://localhost:4321/contact`
3. **Fill out the form** and submit
